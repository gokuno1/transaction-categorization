# Transaction Categorization using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on extracting structured, meaningful information from bank transaction descriptions, which are typically messy, and ambiguous. The goal is to build a machine-learning-driven system that can:

Identify transaction types (e.g., UPI, ATM Withdrawal, ACH Debit, Card Payment).

Extract merchant names from noisy free-text descriptions.

Classify transactions into spending categories (e.g., Food, Utilities, Shopping, Travel).

Prepare high-quality training data for downstream models.

The project is inspired by concepts learned during exploration of the Auth’n’Capture book, which explains the mechanics of the payment ecosystem—debit card number systems, payment gateways, merchant acquiring systems, and settlement logic. This sparked an interest in leveraging that understanding to solve a practical FinTech problem: making sense of transaction logs using NLP.

## Data Preprocessing
### Transaction type identification:
Transaction Type Identification is the first layer of the transaction categorization preprocessing, utilized for determining the payment instrument or channel used in a given transaction description. Bank descriptions typically encode modes such as UPI, IMPS, NEFT, ACH Debit (auto-debit for EMI), Card POS, ATM Withdrawal, Wallet Transfers, or Bank Charges, but these signals are often embedded within specific pattern, partially truncated text. The identification process combines specific keyword dictionaries with regex pattern extraction and fuzzy match to isolate mode indicators, normalize textual variants, and filter out reference numbers or irrelevant metadata. This structured mode classification provides the foundation for downstream tasks — merchant extraction, spending categorization—by ensuring that each transaction is anchored to a well-defined financial channel that reflects user intent and banking rails.

### Merchant name extraction:
Merchant Name Extraction focuses on isolating the merchant or payee entity from highly unstructured transaction descriptions generated by different banking systems, payment gateways, and merchant acquirers. Unlike transaction modes, merchant names do not follow fixed patterns and often appear mixed with reference IDs, terminal numbers, location tags, and banking metadata. The extraction pipeline combines text normalization, token filtering, and domain heuristics with machine-learning methods such as NER models (BERT-based token classification) or seq2seq tagging. These models learn to identify merchant entities in contexts such as UPI payments, POS card swipes, and online transactions, even when formatting varies across banks. The resulting merchant field enables accurate category classification, spend analytics, merchant-level aggregation, and downstream financial insights.
